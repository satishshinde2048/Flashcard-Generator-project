# Flashcard-Generator-Project 

[Click Here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) to see my flashcard generator website.

## Project Description

Flashcard Generator App is a frontend application for creating and managing flashcards. It allows users to create multiple flashcards within a group. The application consists of three main pages:

 1.Create New Page:
   This page enables users to create a new flashcard. It contains two forms: one for entering the name and description of the flashcard, and another for adding 
   individual card names and descriptions. The dynamic form is implemented using Formik. After clicking the Create button, the flashcard will be created.

 2.My FlashCard Page:
   On this page, users can view all the created card groups. Each group is displayed with a heading, description, total number of cards in the group, and a button 
   for viewing the cards on the next page.

 3.FlashCard Details Page:
   This page allows users to view the created flashcards. Users can navigate between different flashcards by clicking on the sidebar terms associated with each 
   card group. Additionally, they can share, print, and download the flashcards.


### Features

 ● Implemented agile methodology for designing, analyzing, and developing the frontend project. The entire project 
   was planned out as a single sprint of 2 weeks.

● This application helps to create new flashcards and access created flashcards.

● Utilized React, React-Redux, and localStorage to manage data, React-router for routing, and Tailwind CSS for 
  component development and responsive design.

● Improved the project’s efficiency by implementing validation using Formik.js on all the existing input fields, 
  and extensive testing was carried out

### Run Locally:

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
